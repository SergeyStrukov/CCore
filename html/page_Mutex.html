<h2>Mutex</h2>

<p class="Files">Files <b>CCore/inc/task/Mutex.h</b> <b>CCore/src/task/Mutex.cpp</b></p>

<p>
<b>Mutex</b> is a mutex, i.e. a class, used to serialize a group of code blocks, executed by multiple threads.
</p>

<pre>

class <span class="Att">Mutex</span> : NoCopy
 {
   ....
   
  public: 
  
   Mutex();
   
   explicit Mutex(TextLabel name);
   
   ~Mutex();
   
   void lock();
  
   void unlock();
  
   typedef LockObject&lt;Mutex&gt; Lock;
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>lock()</b> establishes an exclusive ownership on the mutex from the calling thread. A thread can lock the mutex
multiple times, any extra locks just increases the internal lock counter.
</p>

<p>
If the mutex is locked and a different thread is trying to lock it, then this thread will be 
blocked, until the mutex is released.
</p>

<p>
<b>unlock()</b> is a "memory fence" operation, i.e. all variable changes, made before unlock, will be visible
to other threads, locking the mutex.
</p>

<p>
<b>unlock()</b> is used to release a lock. If the mutex was locked several times, it must be unlocked
the same number of times to be completely released.
</p>

<p>
<span class="Alert">It is highly recommended to lock a mutex using the inner class <b>Lock</b></span>:
</p>

<pre>

Mutex mutex;

 {
  Mutex::Lock lock(mutex);

  ....
 }

</pre>

<p>
A manual calls of the <b>lock()/unlock()</b> must be excluded.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mutex</b> operations are efficient, if they don't cause a task block/release.
</p>

<p>
The most common <b>Mutex</b> usage is to make a class thread-safe:
</p>

<pre>

class SomeClass
 {
   Mutex mutex;

  public:

   void method()
    {
     Mutex::Lock lock(mutex);

     ....
    }
 };

</pre>

<p>
Building a large-scale application, comprised by multiple components, it is easy to create a sadden
deadlock using mutexing in a non-systematic way. So to avoid it I recommend to follow these simple rules:
</p>

<p>
Lock-free context is a part of code which does not hold any mutex. Most of application code must run
in a lock-free context. If you locked a mutex, don't use any other synchronization methods, both
blocking and releasing. Make locked sections of code "quick". Avoid nested mutex locks.
Sometimes you have to nest mutexes, for example, you may call a memory allocation function, which holds
a heap mutex. But in this case there is no risk to create a deadlock. "Leaf" mutexes, i.e. mutexes whose
locked code regions do not make another locks, are deadlock safe. So keep mutexes "leaf", restrict
particular mutex usage by defined code regions, for example, methods of a single class. If you still
have to nest mutex usage, decide an order of locks: one mutex always must be locked before another.
</p>

<h4>HCore Mutex</h4>

<pre>

inline unsigned <span class="Att">MutexSpinCount</span>() { return Sys::GetSpinCount(); }

class <span class="Att">Mutex</span> : NoCopy
 {
   ....

  public: 
  
   explicit Mutex(unsigned spin_count=MutexSpinCount());
   
   explicit Mutex(TextLabel name,unsigned spin_count=MutexSpinCount());
   
   ~Mutex();
   
   void lock();
  
   void unlock();
  
   unsigned getSemCount();
   
   typedef LockObject&lt;Mutex&gt; Lock;
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>HCore</b> <b>Mutex</b> constructor uses the additional argument: <b>spin_count</b>. It is defaulted
to the some target-dependent value. Spinning is used on multi-core systems. If the mutex is locked, then
it is useful not to block the thread immediately, but to "spin" some times, waiting for the mutex release.
</p>

<p>
<b>getSemCount()</b> method can be used for a performance investigations. It is the number of times, when
the mutex called the internal system semaphore.
</p>

<h4>XCore mutex</h4>

<pre>

class <span class="Att">Mutex</span> : NoCopy
 {
   ....
   
  public: 
  
   Mutex();
   
   explicit Mutex(TextLabel name);
   
   ~Mutex();
   
   TextLabel getName() const;

   void lock();
  
   void unlock();
  
   typedef LockObject&lt;Mutex&gt; Lock;
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>XCore</b> <b>Mutex</b> implementation has two important properties.
</p>

<p>
First, it has a mutex deadlock detection. If such situation has happened, then the <b>Abort()</b> with the 
proper diagnostic message is called.
</p>

<p>
Second, the priority inheritance is used to boost task priorities. Normally, each task runs on the given priority.
But in some situations the task priority is temporary boosted. Consider the following case. Task A has locked a mutex.
Task B with higher priority is trying to lock the same mutex. But because it is locked, task B becomes blocked, until
task A release the mutex. In this case the priority of task A is boosted to the priority of task B.
