<h2>RadixHeap</h2>

<p class="Files">Files <b>CCore/inc/RadixHeap.h</b> <b>CCore/src/RadixHeap.cpp</b></p>

<p>
The class <b>RadixHeap</b> is a heart of <b>CCore</b> heaps. It is a complicated class, built from several
parts. The primary part is the template argument <b>Mem</b>, which is responsible for the primary memory allocation.
This class is used to allocated a large memory blocks, then <b>RadixHeap</b> splits them into smaller parts 
(aka blocks) and manages these parts. Each such block starts from the header of the type <b>RadixHeapBlock</b>. 
The part can be used or free. The space after the header in a free block is used to create a special control
object, these objects are used to manage the free blocks set by the <b>RadixHeapStore</b>. 
In used blocks this space is the allocated memory. <span class="Alert">There is no two free consecutive blocks</span>. 
If such blocks appear in the <b>free()</b> operation, they are immediately merged into the single free block.
When block is allocated, it is stamped by the "magic number". This stamp is used to detect incorrect block pointers.
It makes the heap protected from incorrect operations (not 100%).
</p>

<p>
<b>RadixHeapStore</b> manages free heap blocks. The efficiency of this class is a key to the efficiency of the heap
operations. This class uses the set of lists to store small blocks and the radix tree to store large blocks.
That is how we provides constant operation time limits.
</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class Mem&gt;
class <span class="Att">RadixHeap</span> : NoCopy
 {
   Mem large_mem;
   RadixHeapStore store;
   ulen count;

  public:
  
   template &lt;class ... SS&gt;
   explicit RadixHeap(SS && ... ss);
   
   ~RadixHeap();
 
   bool isEmpty() const { return count==0; }
  
   Space alloc(ulen len);               // ret.len!=0 on success (==memlen)
  
   ulen getLen(const void *mem);        // mem!=0, return memlen
   
   ulen free(void *mem);                // mem!=0, return memlen
   
   DeltaLen extend(void *mem,ulen len); // mem!=0

   DeltaLen shrink(void *mem,ulen len); // mem!=0
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>Constructor</b> forwards its arguments to the <b>Mem</b> object (<b>large_mem</b>);
</p>

<p>
<b>isEmpty()</b> returns true, if there is no allocated memory blocks from the heap.
</p>

<p>
<b>alloc()</b> tries to allocate a memory. On failure it returns a null <b>Space</b> object. Otherwise
the resulting <b>Space</b> object contains non-zero memory pointer and non-zero memory length, which is greater 
or equal the argument <b>len</b>.
</p>

<p>
Other methods require a valid non-null pointer <b>mem</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>getLen()</b> returns the length of the memory block.
</p>

<p>
<b>free()</b> releases the memory block, this method returns the length of the memory block.
</p>

<p>
<b>extend()</b> extends the memory block up to the given <b>len</b>, if possible. If the <b>len</b> is
not greater than the length of the memory block, the operation is successful, but change nothing.
The resulting <b>DeltaLen</b> object has the field <b>ok</b>, which indicates success of the operation,
and the field <b>delta</b>, equals the difference between the length of the new block and the old one.
</p>

<p>
<b>shrink()</b> shrinks the memory block down to the given <b>len</b>. This operation is successful only if
the <b>len</b> is not greater than the length of the memory block. The resulting <b>DeltaLen</b> object 
has the field <b>ok</b>, which indicates success of the operation,
and the field <b>delta</b>, equals the difference between the length of the old block and the new one.
</p>

<h4>Primary memory provider</h4>

<p>
A primary memory provider is a class with the following "prototype":
</p>

<pre>
class Mem
 {
   const ulen max_store_len; // aligned

  public:

   Mem(....);

   void cleanup(bool clean);

   ulen getMaxStoreLen() const { return max_store_len; }

   RadixHeapBlock * alloc(ulen blen);            // blen aligned 
                                                 // ( blen<=max_store_len ) => ( ret->len<=max_store_len )

   void free(RadixHeapBlock *block);             // block!=0

   bool extend(RadixHeapBlock *block,ulen blen); // block!=0, blen aligned, blen>block->len

   ulen shrink(RadixHeapBlock *block,ulen blen); // block!=0, blen aligned, blen<=block->len , return delta
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>Mem</b> constructor(s) is custom.
</p>

<p>
Instead of destructor, <b>Mem</b> has the method <b>cleanup()</b>. The argument <b>clean</b> is true, if all memory
blocks have been released, if not the method must fail. If the method is failed, it is recommended to call the 
<b>Abort()</b>. This is because some memory is still in use, but we are going to destroy the heap. 
Continuing execution under such circumstances likely leads to memory destruction.
</p>

<p>
<b>max_store_len</b> is a maximum block length, which is allowed to be splitted and stored. If the block length
is greater, then such blocks are allocated and released as whole. This value must be large enough, for example,
in <b>PageMem</b> it is set to <b>16*1024*Sys::MemPageLen</b>, by default.
</p>

<p>
The method <b>alloc()</b> is called to allocate a large memory block. The argument <b>blen</b> is 
the total block length, it is an aligned value. The method must allocate a block of memory at least required length,
create the <b>RadixHeapBlock</b> object at the beginning of this block, and return the pointer to this object.
If a memory cannot be allocated, the null pointer is returned. If the <b>blen</b> is not greater, than the
<b>max_store_len</b>, then the allocated block length also must not exceed this value. <b>RadixHeapBlock</b> must 
be initialized by the method <b>init(total_block_length)</b>.
</p>

<p>
The method <b>free()</b> is called to release a memory block, once it is not in use. The <b>block</b> 
is always non-null. If you allocate a memory by the <b>RadixHeap</b> and then release it, then the large blocks
will be freed as well. So, to prevent the last block from fluffing, <b>Mem</b> must implement a caching
to avoid unnecessary extra expensive allocation/deallocation.
</p>

<p>
<b>extend()</b> extends the large block. The <b>block</b> is always non-null and the <b>blen</b> is aligned and 
greater than the block length. The method returns <b>true</b> on success. It must reinitalize the <b>block</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>shrink()</b> shrinks the large block. The <b>block</b> is always non-null and the <b>blen</b> is aligned and 
not greater than the block length. The method returns delta length. It must reinitalize the <b>block</b>.
