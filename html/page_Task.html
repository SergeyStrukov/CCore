Tasks and synchronization objects are the heart of any real-time system platform.
The word "task" is used by tradition instead of thread. A typical embedded application may be regarded
as a multi-threaded process, running in a single memory space. It has direct access to all hardware features. 
The functionality of the application is implemented in a series of tasks. The board starts after reboot,
performes a core initializations and runs the main task. At start you need a working RAM, CPU, timers,
interrupt controller, serial port and may be some extra stuff.
Main task performes additional working hardware initialization, prepares and runs tasks.
</p>

<p>
In <b>XCore</b> the entry point to the main task is the usual function <b>main()</b>. Global objects
are constructed before the <b>main()</b> and destructed after. During this phase interrupts are disabled and
running extra tasks is not permitted. When <b>main()</b> is finished, the main task is blocked until all extra 
tasks are completed and then global objects are destroyed.
</p>

<p>
The header <b>Task.h</b> includes all task related stuff. <b>XCore</b> variants of the same classes have
extra features than <b>HCore</b>.
</p>

<p>
To run a task the class <b>Task</b> is used.
</p>

<h4>HCore Task</h4>

<p>
The class <b>Task</b> is polymorphic, with a virtual destructor and derived from the <b>MemBase_nocopy</b>.
A task object must not be destroyed until the associated thread of execution is running.
</p>

<p>
There are two virtual methods of this class to be overloaded in a derived class: <b>entry()</b> and 
<b>exit()</b>. The first implements a task functionality. The second is called to complete the task
execution. You may assume the task is logically finished when this method is called. 
</p>

<pre>
class <span class="att">Task</span> : public MemBase_nocopy
 {
   ....
   
  private:
  
   virtual void entry();
   
   virtual void exit();
  
  public:
  
   Task();
   
   virtual ~Task();
   
   bool run_or_exit();
   
   // task control
   
   static void Yield() { Sys::YieldTask(); }
   
   static void Sleep(MSec time) { Sys::SleepTask(time); }
   
   static Task * GetCurrent();
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>run_or_exit()</b> performes "run of exit" operation. I.g. it tries to start a task. If
the task is started, true is returned. Otherwise, the method <b>exit()</b> is called and false is returned.
You cannot run the same task twice. So <b>exit()</b> is called either way: as the part of <b>run_or_exit()</b> call
or after the task is finished. This method can be used to destroy a dynamically allocated task object, 
to signal about task completion or to do another completion quick job.
</p>

<p>
<b>Yield()</b> rolls the CPU to another running task, if any.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sleep()</b> sleeps the current task for the given period of time in milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
<b>GetCurrent()</b> returns the current running task object. If the current thread was not spawned 
from the <b>Task</b> class, the return value is null.
</p>

<h3>XCore Task</h3>

<p>
<b>XCore</b> <b>Task</b> class is similar to <b>HCore</b>, but has some extra features.
</p>

<pre>
class <span class="att">Task</span> : public MemBase_nocopy
 {
   ....

  private: 
   
   virtual void entry();
   
   virtual void exit();
   
  public:
  
   explicit Task(TaskPriority priority=DefaultTaskPriority,
                 ulen stack_len=DefaultStackLen);
   
   explicit Task(TextLabel name,
                 TaskPriority priority=DefaultTaskPriority,
                 ulen stack_len=DefaultStackLen);
    
   virtual ~Task();
   
   TextLabel getName() const;
      
   TaskPriority getPriority() const;

   bool run_or_exit();
   
   // task control
   
   static void Yield();
   
   static void Sleep(MSec time);
  
   static void RelaxPriority(unsigned period_tick,TaskPriority priority=IdleTaskPriority);
  
   static Task * GetCurrent() { return Current; }
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>XCore</b> <b>Task</b> constructors have additional task parameters. Task can be explicitly named. If the name is
not provided, some auto-generated name is used. This name is used in system logging and event recording.
The <b>TaskPriority</b> is assigned to the task. Task priority determines the task running sequence:
a task with higher priority preempts an execution of tasks with lower priority. The task priority cannot be changed,
but can be temporary raised automatically by synchronization objects. Finally, the task <b>stack_len</b> 
can be specified. The minimum and the default task stack length are defined by the target. 
</p>

<pre>

enum <span class="att">TaskPriority</span> : unsigned
 {
  ExitTaskPriority     = 0,                   // highest
  CompleteTaskPriority = 1,
  
  DefaultTaskPriority  = 10000,               // default
  MainTaskPriority     = DefaultTaskPriority,       
  
  IdleTaskPriority     = unsigned(-1)         // lowest
 };
 
inline bool Preempt(TaskPriority a,TaskPriority b) { return a&lt;b; }

PrintTaskPriority GetTextDesc(TaskPriority priority);

</pre>

<p>
Task priority counts down: the less value means the higher priority. There are three special tasks in the system:
<b>Exit Task</b>, <b>Complete Task</b> and <b>Idle Task</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Idle Task</b> runs while other tasks are blocked. It has the lowest priority.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exit Task</b> is used to call the method <b>exit()</b>. This task can safely destroy another task object.
<b>Exit Task</b> has the highest priority.
</p>

<p>
<b>Complete Task</b> can be used for the packet completion. 
It has the next highest priority after the <b>Exit Task</b>.
Normally packets are completed by processing tasks, but in some cases it should be completed
in the interrupt context. This is not possible, so the special task is provided for 
such packet completion. 
</p>

<p>
It is not recommeded to run a task with one of the special task priority.
</p>

<p>
<b>XCore</b> performes tick task switch. The internal system tick is driven by a timer interrupt.
This tick runs on a high frequency (like 10kHz). Tick switchs ready-to-run tasks and performes
timed jobs, like timeout processing. Without the task priority relaxation only a task with the highest
priority gains CPU time. If there are several such tasks they are switched in a round-robin order.
</p>

<p>
The static method <b>Task::RelaxPriority()</b> enables the task priority relaxation.
It means that during some ticks task priorities are ignored.
The <b>period_tick</b> determines the period of the relaxed ticks. The value 0 means the
task priority relaxation is disabled. The value 1 means that all ticks are relaxed.
The value 2 means that each second tick is relaxed, and so on.
The argument <b>priority</b> determines the cut of priority for the task relaxation.
If the task has this priority or less, it does not participate in the relaxation.
For example, the <b>Idle Task</b> never gains CPU because of the task priority relaxation.
