<h4>UDPSocket</h4>

<p>
This structure supports work with UDP endpoints.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">UDPSocket</span>
 {
  // private

  ....

  // public
  
  struct InResult
   {
    Net::UDPoint src;

</pre>

<p>
Using UDP protocol you can occupy a UDP port and receive UDP packets on that port, also you can send UDP packets
to any host:port destination. To start working with a particular UDP port you create an instance
of the structure <b>UDPSocket</b> and initialize it. Then you use methods of this structure to send and 
receive UDP packets. 
Finally, you uninitialize the instance. Copying of the instances is
prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<b>open()</b> initializes the instance and binds it to the given UDP port.
The error code is returned.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>close()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>close()</b> uninitializes the instance.
The error code is returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>outbound()</b> sends a UDP packet to the given destination. Destination is a pair <b>IP address</b>:<b>UDP port</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>wait_in()</b> waits for inbound packets up to the given timeout. 
The <a href="page_HCore_SysWait.html"><b>WaitResult</b></a> is returned. The value is 0, if a packet
is available for reading, <b>Wait_timeout</b>, if timeout is expired and <b>Wait_error</b>, if some error
happened.
</p>

<p>
<b>indound()</b> reads the packet data from the first inbound packet in the inbound queue and removes the packet
from the queue. If the provided data buffer is not large enough, a error is returned (and the packet is lost).
The return value has the inner type <b>InResult</b>. This structure has three fields: <b>src</b>,
<b>len</b> and <b>error</b>. The <b>src</b> is the address of the packet originator. The <b>len</b> is the
number of bytes, copied to the input buffer, this value is less or equal then the <b>buf.len</b>.
The <b>error</b> is the error code. If the inbound queue is empty, the method blocks. You should never call
this method alone, but only after the call of the method <b>wait()</b> to avoid infinite block.
</p>

<h4>AsyncUDPSocket</h4>

<p>
This structure supports work with UDP endpoints in an asynchronous manner similar to the 
<a href="page_HCore_SysFile.html">async file operations</a>.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">AsyncUDPSocket</span>
 {
  // private

  ....

  // public
  
  struct AsyncState;
  
  typedef AsyncState * Async;
  
  struct OutResult
   {
    bool pending;
    ErrorType error;
   };
  
  struct InResult
   {
    ErrorType error;
    Net::UDPoint src;
    ulen len;
   };
  
  struct StartInResult
   {
    bool pending;
    InResult result;
   };
  
  // public
  
  ErrorType open(Net::UDPort udport) noexcept;
  
  ErrorType close() noexcept;
  
  OutResult startOutbound(Async async,Net::UDPoint dst,PtrLen&lt;const uint8&gt; data) noexcept;
  
  ErrorType completeOutbound(Async async) noexcept;
  
  StartInResult startInbound(Async async,PtrLen&lt;uint8&gt; buf) noexcept;
  
  InResult completeInbound(Async async) noexcept;
 };

</pre>

Finally, you uninitialize the instance. Copying of the instances is

</p>

<p>
<b>open()</b> initializes the instance and binds it to the given UDP port.
The error code is returned.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>close()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>close()</b> uninitializes the instance.
The error code is returned. 
<span class="Alert">This method aborts any pending operations</span>.
</p>

<p>
<b>startOutbound()</b> starts the outbound operation. The first argument is an async token.
This token has the inner type <b>Async</b>, which is usually a pointer to a structure.
The data buffer is in use during the whole operation, so it must be held intact until the
operation is complete. The return value has the inner type <b>OutResult</b>. This structure has
two fields: <b>pending</b> and <b>error</b>. The first field is <b>true</b>, if the operation is not finished yet.
The second is a error code. If the operation is pending, you must wait until the token is finished and then 
complete the operation using the method <b>completeOutbound()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>completeOutbound()</b> completes the pending outbound operation. The error code is returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>startInbound()</b> starts the inbound operation. The first argument is an async token.
This token has the inner type <b>Async</b>, which is usually a pointer to a structure.
The data buffer is in use during the whole operation, so it must be held intact until the
operation is complete. The return value has the inner type <b>StartInResult</b>. This structure has
two fields: <b>pending</b> and <b>result</b>. The first field is <b>true</b>, if the operation is not finished yet.
The second is an operation result. If the operation is pending, you must wait until the token is finished and then 
complete the operation using the method <b>completeInbound()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>completeInbound()</b> completes the pending inbound operation. The operation result is returned.
This value has the inner type <b>InResult</b>. This structure has three fields: <b>error</b>, <b>src</b>
and <b>len</b>. The <b>error</b> is the error code. The <b>src</b> is the address of the packet
originator. The <b>len</b> is the number of bytes, copied to the input buffer, this value is less or equal then the <b>buf.len</b>.
</p>

<p>
To work with async tokens there is the structure <b>AsyncUDPSocketWait</b>.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">AsyncUDPSocketWait</span>
 {
  // private

  ....

  // public
  
  static const ulen MaxAsyncs = 50 ;
  
  ErrorType init(ulen async_count) noexcept;
  
  void exit() noexcept;
  
  AsyncUDPSocket::Async getAsync(ulen index) noexcept;
  
  bool addWait(ulen index) noexcept;
  
  bool delWait(ulen index) noexcept;
  
  WaitResult wait(MSec timeout) noexcept;
  
  WaitResult wait(TimeScope time_scope) noexcept;
  
  void interrupt() noexcept; // async , semaphore
  
  WaitResult waitAll(MSec timeout) noexcept;
  
  WaitResult waitAll(TimeScope time_scope) noexcept;
 };

</pre>

<p>
This structure is a pool of tokens.
To work with tokens you create an instance of this structure and initialize it. 
Then you use its methods to do async socket operations.
Finally, you uninitialize the instance. Copying of the instances is
prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<b>init()</b> initializes the instance. The argument is the async pool size. This value must not
exceed the inner constant <b>MaxAsync</b>. Otherwise the method returns a error.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>exit()</b>.
The pool contains <b>async_count</b> async tokens. They are indexed by the numbers from
the range <b>[0,async_count)</b>. Some of them comprise the "wait set". Initially the set is empty.
</p>

<p>
<b>exit()</b> uninitalizes the instance.
</p>

<p>
<b>getAsync()</b> returns the token with the given index.
</p>

<p>
<b>addWait()</b> adds the token with the given index to the wait set. The return value is <b>true</b>,
if the token was included in the set, and <b>false</b>, if the token is already in the set.
</p>

<p>
<b>delWait()</b> removes the token with the given index from the wait set. The return value is <b>true</b>,
if the token was excluded from the set, and <b>false</b>, if the token is already not in the set.
</p>

<p>
<b>wait()</b> waits while one of the tokens from the wait set is finished, i.e. some async socket operation
is started with this token and it is finished. The return value has the type 
<a href="page_HCore_SysWait.html"><b>WaitResult</b></a>. The value is the index of the token been finished, or
one of the negative special values. Two variants of <b>wait()</b> accepts timeouts of different kinds:
as a <b>MSec</b> or as a <b>TimeScope</b>.
The special return values have the following meanings:
<ol>
 <li><b>Wait_error</b> &mdash; the function has failed for some reason,</li>
 <li><b>Wait_timeout</b> &mdash; the wait is terminated by timeout,</li>
 <li><b>Wait_interrupt</b> &mdash; the wait is terminated by the <b>interrupt().</b></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>interrupt()</b> is a special method. This method can be used to interrupt the <b>wait()</b>.
Unlike other methods, this one can be called in parallel to other method calls. This method
has a "semaphore behavior", i.e. several calls provide several interrupts. 
</p>

<p>
<b>waitAll()</b> waits while all tokens from the wait set are finished. The return value is 0,
if it has happened. Otherwise &mdash; one of special values.
