<h2>Job</h2>

<p class="Files">Files <b>CCore/inc/Job.h</b> <b>CCore/src/Job.cpp</b></p>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> provides a default working thread pool. You can use it on a multi-core CPU to speed-up
some time-consuming calculations. To get a benefit from extra threads, you have to comit them to the pool,
using the class <b>Job::Init</b>.
</p>

<pre>
class <span class="Att">Job::Init</span> : NoCopy
 {
  public:
  
   static unsigned DefaultTaskCount();
  
   explicit Init(unsigned task_count=DefaultTaskCount());
   
   ~Init();
 };
</pre>

<p>
It's a <b>Scope Lock Type</b>, constructor starts and commits working threads to the pool,
destructor stops them and waits until completion. So for the scope duration the pool has committed working threads.
These threads do not consume CPU, unless they are activated to do some job. Only single active <b>Init</b>
object is allowed, an attempt to create another one will throw an exception. 
</p>

<p>
To use the pool service use the class <b>Job</b>.
</p>

<pre>

typedef Function&lt;void (void)&gt; <span class="Att">JobType</span>;

class <span class="Att">Job</span> : SingleHook&lt;JobStarterType&gt; , CustomJob
 {
  public:
  
   explicit Job(JobType job); 
   
   ~Job();
   
   class Init;
 };

</pre>

<p>
First, you have to prepare some job to run. A job is represented by the <b>JobType</b>, which is the
<b>Function&lt;void (void)&gt;</b>. Second, run the job, by creating an object of the type <b>Job</b>: 
</p>

<pre>

{
 JobType job=....;

 Job run_job(job);
}

</pre>

<p>
In its constructor the <b>Job</b> object activates some working threads. The given <b>job()</b> is called
in the context of each activated thread. It's also called in the current thread.
Then destructor waits until all activated threads complete the call. 
</p>

<p>
Sharing the job among several threads is the responsibility of the function <b>job</b>.
</p>

<p>
Only one <b>JobType</b> job can be boosted at the same time. If another <b>Job</b> object is created, while
there is an active one, then the second will not take additional working threads.
</p>

<h3>Starter</h3>

<p>
The <b>Job</b> is implemented using the class <b>Starter</b>.
</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
class <span class="Att">Starter</span> : public Funchor_nocopy
 {
   ....
      
  public:
  
   Starter();
   
   ~Starter();
   
   // control classes
   
   class Start;
    
   class Run;
 };
</pre>

<p>
This class is a generic implementation of the working thread pool. The type <b>T</b> must be a lightweight functor type.
It must have <b>efficient</b> default constructor, copy constructor and assign operator.
<b>Job</b> uses the type <b>JobType</b> as <b>T</b>.
</p>

<p>
There are two control classes for the <b>Starter</b>: <b>Run</b> to commit working threads to the pool and 
<b>Start</b> to use them.
</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;   
class <span class="Att">Starter&lt;T&gt;::Run</span> : NoCopy
 {
   ....
      
  public:
     
   explicit Run(Starter&lt;T&gt; &starter); 
      
   ~Run();
      
   unsigned getTaskCount() const;
 
   unsigned run(unsigned cnt);
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>Run</b> is bound to the given <b>Starter</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>getTaskCount()</b> returns the number of commited to the <b>starter</b> threads.
</p>

<p>
<b>run()</b> commits additional <b>cnt</b> threads. It returns <b>getTaskCount()</b>.
</b>

<p>
Only single <b>Run</b> per <b>Starter</b> is allowed.
</p>

<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;   
class <span class="Att">Starter&lt;T&gt;::Start</span> : NoCopy
 {
   .... 
      
  public: 
     
   Start(Starter&lt;T&gt; *starter,const T &obj); 
    
   ~Start(); 
   
   bool operator + () const;
    
   bool operator ! () const;
 };
</pre>

<p>
<b>Start</b> tries to get the <b>Starter</b> service. If <b>starter</b> is not null and in the idle state, then
constructor commits <b>obj</b> for execution. Available working threads from the pool will call <b>obj()</b>.
There may be zero such threads. Destructor waits until all activated threads complete the call.
</p>

<p>
<b>operator +</b> and <b>operator !</b> can be used to check if the job was successfully started.
