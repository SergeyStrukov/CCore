<p>
To work with a file you create an instance of this structure. Then you open the required file
using the method <b>open()</b>. 
Then you use its methods to do file operations.
Finally, you uninitialize the instance. Copying of the instances is
prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<b>open()</b> initializes the instance and prepare it to perform file operations of the given file.
The error code is returned. The first argument is the file name. The second is the open flags.
The meaning of the flags is described in the <a href="page_Files.html">general file operation set</a>.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>close()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>close()</b> closes the file. The first variant uses the provided <b>FileMultiError</b> object
to return operation error(s). If the flag <b>preserve_file</b> is <b>true</b>, the file is preserved,
even if it was opened with the <b>Open_AutoDelete</b> flag.
The second variant does not report any errors and does not preserve the file, opened with the <b>Open_AutoDelete</b> flag.
</p>

<p>
<b>write()</b> writes the given byte range to the file at the current file position. The file
position is updated. The return value has the inner type <b>IOResult</b>. This structure has
two fields: <b>len</b> and <b>error</b>. The <b>len</b> is the number of bytes have been written and the 
<b>error</b> is the error code. The <b>len</b> is less or equal than the argument <b>len</b>.
The file may be extended by this operation. If the operation is successful, the resulting length
should be equal the input length. Other behavior is not recommended.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Write</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>read()</b> reads the byte range from the file to the provided buffer from the current file position.
The file position is updated. The return value has the inner type <b>IOResult</b>. This structure has
two fields: <b>len</b> and <b>error</b>. The <b>len</b> is the number of bytes have been red and the 
<b>error</b> is the error code. The <b>len</b> is less or equal than the argument <b>len</b>.
If the operation is successful, the resulting length should be equal minimum of the input length
and the number of bytes after the current file position to the end of file.
Other behavior is not recommended.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Read</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>getLen()</b> returns the current length of the file. The return value is represented by the
inner structure <b>PosResult</b>. This structure has two fields: <b>pos</b> and <b>error</b>.
<b>pos</b> is the length of the file, <b>error</b> is the error code.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Pos</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>getPos()</b> returns the current position of the file. The return value is represented by the
inner structure <b>PosResult</b>. This structure has two fields: <b>pos</b> and <b>error</b>.
The <b>pos</b> is the file position, the <b>error</b> is the error code.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Pos</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>setPos()</b> sets the current position of the file. The error code is returned.
If the position is after the end-of-file, the behavior is undefined. If you want to extend the file,
it can be done by the method <b>write()</b>.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Pos</b>.
</p>

<h4>Alternative file access</h4>

<p>
The structure <b>AltFile</b> implements an alternative file access.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">AltFile</span>

</p>

<p>
<b>write()</b> writes the given byte range to the file. The file position to write
is given by the first argument. This operation may extend the file.
The return value has the inner type <b>Result</b>. This structure has two fields: <b>file_len</b>
and <b>error</b>. The <b>file_len</b> is the new length of the file, the <b>error</b> is the error code.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Write</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>read()</b> reads the byte range from the file to the provided buffer. The file position to read
is given by the first argument. The error code is returned. The read range must not cross end-of-file.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Read</b>.
</p>

<h4>Async file access</h4>

<p>
The structure <b>AltFile</b> implements an alternative file access in an asynchronus manner.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">AltAsyncFile</span>
 {

To work with a file you create an instance of this structure. Then you open the required file
using the method <b>open()</b>. 
Then you use its methods to do file operations.
Finally, you uninitialize the instance. Copying of the instances is
prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<b>open()</b> initializes the instance and prepare it to perform file operations of the given file.
The return value has the inner type <b>Result</b>. This structure has two fields: <b>file_len</b>
and <b>error</b>. The <b>file_len</b> is the length of the file, the <b>error</b> is the error code.
The first argument is the file name. The second is the open flags.
This kind of file has no an internal file position.
The meaning of the flags is described in the <a href="page_Files.html">general file operation set</a>.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>close()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>close()</b> closes the file. The first variant uses the provided <b>FileMultiError</b> object
to return operation error(s). If the flag <b>preserve_file</b> is <b>true</b>, the file is preserved,
even if it was opened with the <b>Open_AutoDelete</b> flag.
The second variant does not report any errors and does not preserve the file, opened with the <b>Open_AutoDelete</b> flag.
All pending file read/write operations must be finished before the call of this method. 
</p>

<p>
<b>testRead()</b> checks the read position. 
If the read range does not fit into the file range it returns the error.
The error code is returned.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Read</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>setWrite()</b> prepares the file write operation. It checks the write range for overflow
and increases the internal file length field, if the file is to be extended.
This method must be called before the <b>startWrite()</b>.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Write</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>startRead()</b> starts the read operation. The first argument is an async token. The type of this token
is the inner type <b>Async</b> and usually it is the pointer to some structure (<b>AsyncState</b>).
The return value has the inner type <b>RWResult</b>. It has two fields: <b>pending</b> and 
<b>error</b>. The first field is <b>true</b>, if the operation is pending, otherwise
it is finished. The second is the error code. If the operation is finished, no other steps are required.
If the operation is pending, you must wait until the token is finished and then call the method
<b>completeRead()</b>.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Read</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>completeRead()</b> complets the read operation. The first argument is the operation token, the second
is the original argument <b>len</b> from the <b>startRead()</b> call. This method must be used only
after the correspondent async token is reported finished. The error code is returned.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Read</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>startWrite()</b> starts the write operation. The first argument is an async token. The type of this token
is the inner type <b>Async</b> and usually it is the pointer to some structure (<b>AsyncState</b>).
The return value has the inner type <b>RWResult</b>. It has two fields: <b>pending</b> and 
<b>error</b>. The first field is <b>true</b>, if the operation is pending, otherwise
it is finished. The second is the error code. If the operation is finished, no other steps are required.
If the operation is pending, you must wait until the token is finished and then call the method
<b>completeWrite()</b>.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Write</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>completeWrite()</b> complets the write operation. The first argument is the operation token, the second
is the original argument <b>len</b> from the <b>startWrite()</b> call. This method must be used only
after the correspondent async token is reported finished. The error code is returned.
This operation is available only if the file has been opened with the flag <b>Open_Write</b>.
</p>

<p>
The length of any read or write operation must not exceed <b>MaxRWLen</b>, which should has the value
like 1 MByte.
</p>

<p>
Here is a pattern to do a read operation:
</p>

<pre>

AltAsyncFile::Async async=&lt;acquire an unused async token&gt;;

if( auto error=file.testRead(off,len) ) 
  {
   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return error; 
  }

auto result=file.startRead(async,off,buf,len);

if( result.error ) 
  {
   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return result.error; 
  }

if( result.pending )
  {
   &lt;wait until async is finished&gt;;

   auto error=file.completeRead(async,len);

   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return error;
  }
else
  {
   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return FileError_Ok;
  }

</pre>

<p>
Here is a pattern to do a write operation:
</p>

<pre>

AltAsyncFile::Async async=&lt;acquire an unused async token&gt;;

auto op_result=file.startWrite(off,len);

if( op_result.error ) 
  {
   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return {op_result.error,0}; 
  }

auto result=file.startWrite(async,off,buf,len);

if( result.error ) 
  {
   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return {result.error,0}; 
  }

if( result.pending )
  {
   &lt;wait until async is finished&gt;;

   auto error=file.completeWrite(async,len);

   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return {error,op_result.file_len};
  }
else
  {
   &lt;release async&gt;;

   return {FileError_Ok,op_result.file_len};
  }

</pre>

<p>
To work with async tokens there is the structure <b>AsyncFileWait</b>.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">AsyncFileWait</span>
 {
  // private

  ....

  // public
  
  static const ulen MaxAsyncs = .... ; // like 50-100
  
  FileError init(ulen async_count) noexcept;
  
  void exit() noexcept;
  
  AltAsyncFile::Async getAsync(ulen index) noexcept;
  
  bool addWait(ulen index) noexcept;
  
  bool delWait(ulen index) noexcept;
  
  WaitResult wait(MSec timeout) noexcept;
  
  WaitResult wait(TimeScope time_scope) noexcept;
  
  void interrupt() noexcept; // async , semaphore
 };

</pre>

<p>
This structure is a pool of tokens.
To work with tokens you create an instance of this structure and initialize it. 
Then you use its methods to do async file operations.
Finally, you uninitialize the instance. Copying of the instances is
prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<b>init()</b> initalizes the instance. The argument is the async pool size. This value must not
exceed the inner constant <b>MaxAsync</b>. Otherwise the method returns a error.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>exit()</b>.
The pool contains <b>async_count</b> async tokens. They are indexed by the numbers from
tne range <b>[0,async_count)</b>. Some of them comprise the "wait set". Initially the set is empty.
</p>

<p>
<b>exit()</b> uninitalizes the instance.
</p>

<p>
<b>getAsync()</b> returns the token with the given index.
</p>

<p>
<b>addWait()</b> adds the token with the given index to the wait set. The return value is <b>true</b>,
if the token was included in the set, and <b>false</b>, if the token is already in the set.
</p>

<p>
<b>delWait()</b> removes the token with the given index from the wait set. The return value is <b>true</b>,
if the token was excluded from the set, and <b>false</b>, if the token is already not in the set.
</p>

<p>
<b>wait()</b> waits while one of the tokens from the wait set is finished, i.e. some async file operation
is started with this token and it is finished. The return value has the type 
<a href="page_HCore_SysWait.html"><b>WaitResult</b></a>. The value is the index of the token been finished, or
one of the negative special values. Two variants of <b>wait()</b> accepts timeouts of different kinds:
as a <b>MSec</b> or as a <b>TimeScope</b>.
The special return values have the following meanings:
<ol>
 <li><b>Wait_error</b> &mdash; the function has failed for some reason,</li>
 <li><b>Wait_timeout</b> &mdash; the wait is terminated by timeout,</li>
 <li><b>Wait_interrupt</b> &mdash; the wait is terminated by the <b>interrupt().</b></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>interrupt()</b> is a special method. This method can be used to interrupt the <b>wait()</b>.
Unlike other methods, this one can be called in parallel to other method calls. This method
has a "semaphore behavior", i.e. several calls provide several interrupts.
