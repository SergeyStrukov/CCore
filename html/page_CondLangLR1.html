<h2>CondLangLR1</h2>

<p>
This utility generates LR1 parsing state machine for the given LR1 language.
The language is defined using the <i>conditional recursive grammar</i>.
</p>

<pre>

CondLangLR1.exe &lt;file-name&gt;

</pre>

<p>
The only command-line argument is the language file name. If the file name has no extension, <b>.lang</b> is added.
</p>

<p>
On success two files are generated: <b>.txt</b> file and <b>.ddl</b> file.
They have the same name as the input file and located in the same directory. 
<b>.txt</b> file contains processing information in a readable form.
<b>.ddl</b> file contains the state machine description in <b>DDL2</b> format.
The file <b>LangType.ddl</b> in <b>CCORE_ROOT/tools/CondLangLR1</b> contains required <b>DDL2</b> type definitions.
</p>

<p>
On failure the only <b>.bad.txt</b> file is generated. You can examine this file to understand, why
the input is not an LR1 language and try to fix it.
</p>

<h3>AMP</h3>

<p>
Below is the file <b>AMP.lang</b> with the definition of the <b>AMP</b> language.
</p>

<pre>
/* AMP.lang */

! EXPR : A , M , P
 {
  x               : opVar  = P

  ( EXPR )        : opBra  = P

  EXPR + EXPR.a   : if( a&gt;=M ) opAdd  = A

  EXPR.a * EXPR.b : if( a&gt;=P & b&gt;=M ) opMul  = M
 }

</pre>

<p>
You may see the output for this language in the directory <b>CCORE_ROOT/tools/CondLangLR1/AMP</b>.
</p>

<h2>Conditional recursive grammar</h2>

<p>
Conditional recursive grammar is an advanced version of <a href="page_LangLR1.html#lang">context-free grammer</a>. To define a language by
a uniquely decoded grammar it is often you have to introduce extra non-terminals. For example, you can
define <b>AMP</b> language by the following grammar:
</p>

<pre>

! EXPR
 {
  x               : opVar

  ( EXPR )        : opBra

  EXPR + EXPR     : opAdd

  EXPR * EXPR     : opMul
 }

</pre>

<p>
but this grammar is not uniquely decoded. To make it such you may introduce extra non-terminals:
</p>

<pre>

! A
 {
  M     : cast_A
  A + M : opAdd
 }
 
M
 {
  P     : cast_M
  P * M : opMul
 }
 
P
 {
  x     : opVar
  ( A ) : opBra 
 } 

</pre>

<p>
Conditional grammar is an alternative way. Instead defining of new non-terminals, we introduce
"kinds". Kind is a property of a non-terminal production. 
</p>

<pre>

! EXPR : A , M , P
 {
  x               : opVar  = P

  ( EXPR )        : opBra  = P

  EXPR + EXPR.a   : if( a&gt;=M ) opAdd  = A

  EXPR.a * EXPR.b : if( a&gt;=P & b&gt;=M ) opMul  = M
 }

</pre>

<p>
Here is the non-terminal <b>EXPR</b> with three associated kinds: <b>A</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>P</b>.
When we produce a word of this non-terminal class, we assign a kind to it, it is designated by the trailing 
<b>= kind</b> statement. A particular production rule may have an associated condition, 
this condition must be satisfied to apply this rule. For example, the rule <b>opAdd</b> can only be applied
if the kind of the second subexpression (<b>.a</b>) is <b>M</b> or <b>P</b>.
</p>

<p>
Using conditional grammars you avoid rule redundancy. You don't need "cast" rules.
The language description becomes also more intuitive.
</p>

<p>
You can read more about conditional recursive grammars in <a type="application/pdf" href="../doc/Conditional recursive grammars.pdf">this document</a>.
</p>

<h2>Grammar description</h2>

<p>
We use the term "syntax class" or "synt" for non-terminals. The grammar description consists of synt descriptions.
Each synt has a unique name, it must be a <b>C</b> name. Some synts (usually one) are language synts, the 
resulting language is a union of these synt's productions. These synts are prefixed with the character <b>!</b>.
A synt description starts with the synt name, optionally preceded by the character <b>!</b>.
If the synt has associated kinds, the synt description continues with the sign <b>:</b> and following
comma separated kind names. Kind names must be <b>C</b> names and must be unique for each synt. At least 
one kind must be provided.
Then production rule descriptions follows, enclosed in the figure brackets.
</p>

<pre>

LANG-DESCRIPTION  <b>=</b>  SYNT-DESCRIPTION<sub>1</sub> SYNT-DESCRIPTION<sub>2</sub> ... SYNT-DESCRIPTION<sub>n</sub>

SYNT-DESCRIPTION  <b>=</b>  !<sup>opt</sup> SyntName KIND-DESCRIPTION<sup>opt</sup> { RULES-DESCRIPTION }

KIND-DESCRIPTION  <b>=</b>  : KindName<sub>1</sub> , KindName<sub>2</sub> , ... , KindName<sub>n</sub>

</pre>

<p>
Kinds of a same synt are considered as linear ordered. The order is defined by the appearance, i.e. 
a kind is less than another kind, if it appears early in the kinds list.  
</p>

<pre>

KindName<sub>1</sub> < KindName<sub>2</sub> < ... < KindName<sub>n</sub>

</pre>

<p>
A kind has an associated numeric value, which is the index in the kinds list.
</p>

<p>
Rules description is a sequence of rule descriptions.
</p>

<pre>

RULES-DESCRIPTION  <b>=</b>  RULE-DESCRIPTION<sub>1</sub> RULE-DESCRIPTION<sub>2</sub> ... RULE-DESCRIPTION<sub>n</sub>

</pre>

<p>
Each rule description starts from the rule elements sequence. During this part of the input the text is parsed by 
words, divided by space characters. To terminate it you must enter either <b>:</b> to finish the 
rule elements sequence or <b>}</b> to close the rule descriptions, surrounded by at least one 
space character before and after.
</p>

<pre>

RULE-DESCRIPTION  <b>=</b>  RULE-ELEMENTS : RULE_COND<sup>opt</sup> RuleName RULE_KIND<sup>opt</sup>

RULE_KIND         <b>=</b>  = KindName

</pre>

<p>
Each rule has a rule name, it must be either a <b>C</b> name or a compound <b>C</b> name, concatenated from several
<b>C</b> names by the character <b>@</b>, and must be unique for each synt. If the synt has kinds, 
a rule kind must be given, otherwise it must not present.
</p>

<pre>

RULE-ELEMENTS <b>=</b> ELEMENT<sub>1</sub> ... ELEMENT<sub>n</sub>

</pre>

<p>
Rule elements part is parsed on words, separated by space characters. Each word is a 
sequence of printable non-space characters. The word can be a synt name or an atom name. 
Synt name may have a dot-suffix with variable name. Everything which is not a synt name 
is considered as an atom name. Language atom set is defined implicitly by collecting atom names from
rule definitions.
</p>

<pre>

ELEMENT-SYNT <b>=</b> SyntName
               SyntName.VariableName

</pre>

<p>
Two one-character words <b>}</b> and <b>:</b> cannot be used to define an atom. But you can introduce an atom 
with such name using the character <b>`</b> as the prefix, i.e. <b>`}</b> and <b>`:</b> 
are considered as atom names, but modified to the names <b>}</b> and <b>:</b>. 
Also <b>``}</b> is modified to <b>`}</b>, <b>```}</b> to <b>``}</b> and so on.
</p>

<p>
A rule may have an associated rule condition of the form:
</p>

<pre>

RULE-COND <b>=</b> if ( COND-EXPR )

</pre>

<p>
A condition expression is an expression, built from prime expressions using the logical operations
<b>&</b> (logical AND), <b>|</b> (logical OR) and <b>!</b> (logical NOT). <b>&</b> has a higher priority 
than <b>|</b>. Brackets can be used to specify the order of evaluation.
</p>

<p>
Prime expressions are comparison expressions:
</p>

<pre>

  Name<sub>1</sub> == Name<sub>2</sub>
  Name<sub>1</sub> != Name<sub>2</sub>
  Name<sub>1</sub> < Name<sub>2</sub> 
  Name<sub>1</sub> <= Name<sub>2</sub>
  Name<sub>1</sub> > Name<sub>2</sub> 
  Name<sub>1</sub> >= Name<sub>2</sub>

</pre>

<p>
Each name either a variable name or a kind name. At least one name must be a variable name. 
Variables are introduced in the rule element list as the dot-suffix of the synt name. For example,
</p>

<pre>

  EXPR.a * EXPR.b : if( a&gt;=P & b&gt;=M ) opMul  = M

</pre>

<p>
here two variables were introduced: <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>. Each of them designate the kind of 
the correspondent synt production. If the name is a kind name, the corespondent kind is looked-up among the
kinds of the synt, the other name is a variable of. I.e. in the example above <b>P</b> is looked-up among
the kinds of the synt <b>EXPR</b>. Kinds are compared using they numeric values.
</p>

<p>
There is a special kind of synts: <b>noneof</b> synts. They are described as following:
</p>

<pre>

noneof SyntName 
 {
  atom<sub>1</sub> ... atom<sub>n</sub> : RuleName
 }

</pre>

<p>
This synt produces all one-atom words from atoms not from the given list. I.e. it is equivalent the
following description:
</p>

<pre>

SyntName
 {
  atom<sub>n+1</sub> : RuleName@...
  ...
  atom<sub>m</sub>   : RuleName@...
 }

</pre>

<p>
There are following description entities: <b>Atom</b>, <b>Synt</b>, <b>Kind</b>, <b>Element</b>, 
<b>Rule</b>, <b>TopRule</b>, <b>State</b> and <b>Final</b>.
The structure <b>Lang</b> consists of arrays of these entities. It also has the field <b>lang</b>, 
which is the array of pointers to <b>Synt</b>, these synts are language synts.
Each structure has the field <b>index</b>. This field is the index in the correspondent structure array.
For example, <b>lang.atoms[I].index==I</b>. Also those structures, which has the associated name, have the 
field <b>name</b> of the type <b>text</b> with this name.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>Atom</b> has fields <b>index</b>, <b>name</b> and <b>element</b>. The last field is a pointer
to the correspondent <b>Element</b>.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>Synt</b> has fields <b>index</b>, <b>name</b>, <b>kinds</b> and <b>rules</b>.
<b>kinds</b> is the kinds, associated with this synt. If the synt has no kinds, this array has the length 
<b>1</b> and contains a single auto-generated kind of this synt. 
The array <b>rules</b> is the list of rules for this synt.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>Kind</b> has two indexes. First, <b>index</b> is the index in the correspondent <b>Synt</b> array.
Another, <b>kindex</b> is a global kind index for all kinds of all synts. 
The name of the auto-generated kind is the empty string.
The field <b>synt</b> points to the synt this kind belongs to.
The field <b>element</b> is the correspondent element.
The array <b>rules</b> is the list of "top" rules for this kind.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>Element</b> describes elements. The element set is a disjoint union of atoms and synt kinds.
Atoms go first and kinds after. The structure has fields <b>index</b> and <b>elem</b>. <b>elem</b>
is a polymorphic pointer and points to the correspondent atom or kind.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>Rule</b> describes a rule. The field <b>result</b> is the resulting kind of the resulting synt.
The field <b>args</b> is the list of rule arguments. It is a sequence of atoms and synts. This description
has no rule conditions. Instead, we derive a set of "top" rules.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>TopRule</b> describes a top rule. The field <b>name</b> is the name of the top rule.
This name is a composition of the bottom rule name and dot suffixes with the argument kinds.
The field <b>bottom</b> is the bottom rule, this top rule has been derived from.
The field <b>result</b> is the rule result.
The field <b>args</b> is the list of rule arguments. It is a sequence of atoms and kinds.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>State</b> describes a state of the parsing state machine. It has fields <b>index</b>, <b>final</b>
and <b>transitions</b>. The first state (with the index <b>0</b>) is the start state. <b>transitions</b>
is the set of transitions from this state. Each transition is described by an element of the structure
<b>State#Transition</b> with two fields: <b>element</b> and <b>state</b>. <b>element</b> is the pointer
to the element, which cause the transition, and <b>state</b> is the pointer to the target state.
<b>final</b> is the "final", associated with the state. The array <b>transitions</b> is ordered by 
the <b>element->index</b>.
</p>

<p>
The structure <b>Final</b> describes the list of actions. Each action is described by an element of the
structure <b>Final#Action</b> with two fields: <b>atom</b> and <b>rule</b>. <b>atom</b> is
a pointer to an atom or null. If this atom (or the end of atom sequence) is seen, then the correspondent
<b>rule</b> must be applied. <b>rule</b> is the pointer to the action rule or null, if the atom must 
be shifted to the parsing stack. If the <b>atom</b> is null, then the null value  of the <b>rule</b>
means the end of the parsing process. The array <b>actions</b> is ordered by the <b>atom->index</b>.
The action with null <b>atom</b>, if any, goes first.
</p>
