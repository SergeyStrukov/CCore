<h2>Move idiom (related with <a href="page_Swap.html">Swap idiom</a>)</h2>

<p class="Files">Files <b>CCore/inc/Move.h</b> <b>CCore/src/Move.cpp</b></p>

<p>
First of all, <b>CCore</b> <b>Move</b> is not a C++11 move. Don't mess it up.
<b>Move</b> is designed to solve the following task: assume you have an object and you want to
move it to another memory location. Once you have an appropriate block of memory, you need to
create the copy of the object there and destroy the original object as the one operation. 
Unlike the copy operation, <b>Move</b> can be implemented as an efficient operation for a wide range of 
types. This is because we don't need to create an additional state, we just have to replace the existing 
one into another memory location. So before the operation we have the object and the raw memory, 
after we have the raw memory and the moved object.
</p>

<p>
There is a technical difficulty with the <b>Move</b> implementation: C++ requires a some constructor call
for the object creation and the destuctor call for the object life-time termination 
(with some minor exceptions). To make the moving derivable we have to use the <b>Move constructor</b> as
the implementation point for it.
</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<pre>
template &lt;class T&gt;
T * <span class="Att">CopyMove</span>(T *obj,Place&lt;void&gt; place) noexcept(EnableNoExcept); // for efficiently copyable classes

template &lt;class T&gt;
T * <span class="Att">SwapMove</span>(T *obj,Place&lt;void&gt; place) noexcept(EnableNoExcept); // for classes with <b>objSwap()</b>
                                                                 // and efficient default

template &lt;class T&gt;
T * <span class="Att">CtorMove</span>(T *obj,Place&lt;void&gt; place) noexcept(EnableNoExcept); // for classes with <b>Move constructor</b>

template &lt;class T&gt;
T * <span class="Att">Move</span>(T *obj,Place&lt;void&gt; place) noexcept(EnableNoExcept); // general
</pre>

<p>
Normally you should use the function <b>Move()</b> for <b>Move</b> operation.
If the destined type is a class type with the method <b>objMove()</b>, it is called to do the job.
Otherwise, if the destined type is a class type with the method <b>objSwap()</b>, the 
<b>SwapMove()</b> is used. In this case <span class="Alert">class must have the default efficient constructor</span>.
Finally, <b>CopyMove()</b> is called for remaining cases. It is assumed, that such types are
<span class="Alert">efficiently copyable</span>.
</p>

<p>
You can also specialize the <b>struct MoveAdapters</b>.
</p>

<pre>
namespace N {

class C
 {
  ....
 };

}

namespace CCore {

template&lt;&gt;
struct MoveAdapters&lt;false,false,N::C&gt;
 {
  static N::C * Move(N::C *obj,Place&lt;void&gt; place) { .... }
 };

}
</pre>

<p>
The most convenient way to make a class movable is to define the method <b>objSwap()</b> and make it
both swapable and moveable. But for the sake of efficiency, you may define the method <b>objMove()</b>.
In this case the best way is to define the same time the <b>Move constructor</b> and derived <b>objMove()</b>
from it.
Consider the following example:
</p>

<pre>
struct S
 {
  A a; // class A has <b>Move constructor</b>
  B b; // type B is efficiently copyable
  C c; // class C has <b>Move constructor</b>

  // swap/move objects
   
  void <span class="Att">objSwap</span>(S &obj)
   {
    Swap(a,obj.a);
    Swap(b,obj.b);
    Swap(c,obj.c);
   }
   
  explicit <span class="Att">S(ToMoveCtor&lt;S&gt; obj)</span> // the <b>Move constructor</b> signature

   : a(ObjToMove(obj->a)),      // member move with its <b>Move constructor</b>
     b(obj->b),                 // member move by copying
     c(ObjToMove(obj->c))       // member move with its <b>Move constructor</b>
   {
   }

  S * <span class="Att">objMove</span>(Place&lt;void&gt; place)
   {
    return CtorMove(this,place);
   }
 };
</pre>

<p>
The reason to define the <b>Move constructor</b> is to support the further derivation of it.
The <b>Move constructor</b> is called in the following context: <span class="Hint">an object is being moving,
the original object will be destoyed by the call of destructor right after <b>Move constructor</b>
is finished</span>.
Here is the template for the moving of <b>Resource Host Types</b>.
</p>

<pre>
class H : NoCopy
 {
  private:

   ResourceHandle h; // <b>Small Data Type</b>

  public: 

   H() { SetNull(h); }

   H(A a,B b,C c) { h=New(a,b,c); }

   ~H() { <span class="Alert">if( NotNull(h) )</span> Delete(h); } // may help compiler to eliminate the following
                                        //
                                        // SetNull(h);
                                        // if( NotNull(h) ) Delete(h);
                                        // end-of-object-life-time; 
                                        //
                                        // sequence of actions
   // move objects

   explicit H(ToMoveCtor&lt;H&gt; obj)
    {
     h=obj->h;

     <span class="Alert">SetNull(obj->h);</span>
    }

   H * objMove(Place&lt;void&gt; place)
    {
     return CtorMove(this,place);
    }
 };
</pre>

<p>The class <b>ToMoveCtor&lt;T&gt;</b> is a simple wrapper over the pointer to the type T:</p>

<pre>
/* struct ToMoveCtor&lt;T&gt; */ 

template &lt;class T&gt;
struct ToMoveCtor
 {
  T *obj;
 
  explicit ToMoveCtor(T &obj_) { obj=&amp;obj_; }
  
  T * operator -> () const { return obj; }
  
  template &lt;class S&gt;
  ToMoveCtor&lt;S&gt; cast() const { return ToMoveCtor&lt;S&gt;(*obj); }
 };
</pre>

<p>It is soleyly introduced to designate <b>Move constructors</b>. The method <b>cast()</b> can be used to "touch" 
a base class subobject in the <b>Move constructor</b> body.
</p>

<h2>C++11 move constructor and Move constructor</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> is not using C++11 move constructors for <b>Moving</b>.
C++11 move constructors were introduced to solve some language problems.
The first problem is the returning value from a function. Consider this:
</p>

<pre>
class C
 {
  public:

   C(C &&src);

   ~C();
 };

C func()
 {
  C obj;

  return obj; // move object here instead of copy
 }
</pre>

<p>
But this solution is a wrongdoing. The proper approach would be the change of the return semantic:
operator return should construct the object using any desired constructor instead of copying it.
</p>

<pre>
class Class
 {
  public:

   Class(A a,B b,C c);

   ~Class();
 };

Class func()
 {
  A a;
  B b;
  C c;

  return(a,b,c); // calls Class(a,b,c) to create the return object
 }
</pre>

<p>
The problem with the move constructor is it is a <b>destructive implicit operation</b> and as such is a error-prone.
So in <b>CCore</b> C++11 move is prohibited. Instead we are using the <b>Move constructor</b>,
which is explicit and is called only under specified condition: <span class="Hint">the destructor 
of the argument is called right after constructor is called, 
i.e. there is no other methods of the argument are called between them</span>.
