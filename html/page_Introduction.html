<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
<b>CCore</b> is a platform primary for developing real-time applications. It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt">Boost Software License</a>.
You can use <b>CCore</b> to build host applications also, but without any real-time properties. 
We use the term "host application" to designate an application, running on the host machine, 
currently under Windows OS.
"stand-alone application" means an application, running on a stand-alone device. 
<b>CCore</b> is a multi-target platform, you can (and, in fact, must!) develop your own target (host or stand-alone)
for your specific target device. The installation of <b>CCore</b> provides the following targets:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WIN32</b> &mdash; default host target,</li>
<li><b>IXDP465</b> &mdash; stand-alone target for Intel IXDP465 developmnent board,</li>
<li><b>Vanilla-H</b> &mdash; host target template,</li>
<li><b>Vanilla-X</b> &mdash; stand-alone target template.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Target</b> includes compiler and tools, makefile rules and part of source code, specific for the target. 
In most cases you are encouraged to develope components of you application using <b>WIN32</b> target and 
then port it to a stand-alone target when it's ready. <b>CCore</b> is developed in target-independent 
and platform-independent manner (despite it's a platform itself!). So it's recommended to follow this
practice. Developing components on a host target usually is simpler and more productive.
</p>
<p>
<b>CCore</b> is implemented using C++11. It enables the full advantage of this renewed language for
embedded and real-time software development. You can also use it to build usual host applications.
<b>CCore</b> is based on comprehensive, type-rich library, well, <b>CCore</b>. That's the core part
of the platform. The next part is <b>HCore</b> for host targets and <b>XCore</b> for stand-alone targets.
On host targets we rely on an operating system to perform some tasks (like primary memory management, 
task synchronization etc.). So a host target provides a tiny layer between <b>HCore</b> and OS system calls.
But on a stand-alone target we implements these fundamental functions ourself. <b>XCore</b> is an 
implementaion of this part for single-core CPUs. A target provides an implementaion of very low-level 
CPU specific functions <b>XCore</b> is based on. For example, the following 3 functions are required for interrupt lock support:
</p>

<pre>
/* functions */ 

bool <span class="Alert">IsIntContext()</span> noexcept;

/* classes */ 

class IntLock;

/* class IntLock */ 

class IntLock : NoCopy
 {
   bool enable;

  public:

   IntLock() { enable=Internal::Disable(); }
 
   ~IntLock() { if( enable ) Internal::Enable(); }
   
   struct Internal
    {
     static bool <span class="Alert">Disable()</span> noexcept;
     
     static void <span class="Alert">Enable()</span> noexcept;
    };
 };
</pre>
