<p>
To perform a file system operation you create an instance of the structure <b>FileSystem</b>
and initialize it. Then you use this structure methods to do desired operations. Finally, you 
uninitialize the instance. 
Copying of the instances is prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
It's very likely, that the structure has no data fields. In such case
its methods can be declared static. But you should not use them as such.
<span class="Alert">This structure uses types and constants from the <b>GenFile.h</b>, this includes error codes.</span>
</p>

<p>
<b>init()</b> initializes the instance. The error code is returned.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>exit()</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>exit()</b> uninitialize the instance.
</p>

<p>
<b>getFileType()</b> returns the file type. The argument specifies a file or a directory.
The return value is represented by the inner structure <b>TypeResult</b>. This structure has two fields:
<b>type</b> and <b>error</b>. The <b>type</b> is the object type, the <b>error</b> is the error code. 
</p>

<p>
<b>createFile()</b> creates the new empty file with the given name. The error code is returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>deleteFile()</b> deletes the file with the given name. The error code is returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>createDir()</b> creates the empty directory with the given name. The error code is returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>deleteDir()</b> deletes the directory with the given name. The error code is returned.
The second argument is a recursion flag. If it is <b>false</b>, then the directory must be empty.
Otherwise the directory is deleted with all its content, including nested subdirectories.
</p>

<p>
<b>rename()</b> renames or moves the file of directory. The error code is returned.
The <b>allow_overwrite</b> flag allows overwriting the existing file. 
</p>

<p>
<b>remove()</b> deletes ether the existing file or the existing empty directory. The error code is returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>exec()</b> is not a file system operation. It is an extra operation. This methods starts a new process.
The <b>dir</b> is the working directory of the new process, the <b>program</b> is the executable file name,
the <b>arg</b> is the command line.
</p>

<p>
<b>pathOf()</b> is another extra operation. This method builds a normalized full path of the
file or directory. The <b>buf</b> is a storage buffer for the result. The resulting string is zero-terminated.
The return value is represented by the inner structure <b>PathOfResult</b>.
This structure has two fields: <b>path</b> and <b>error</b>. The <b>path</b> is the resulting path,
the <b>error</b> is the error code.
</p>

<p>
<b>DirCursor</b> is the inner structure. 
This structure can be used to iterate over the content of a directory.
Copying of the instances is prohibited. The private content of the structure is target-dependent.
</p>

<p>
<b>file_name</b> is the buffer for the file name. The only file part is stored here.
The name is not zero-terminated.
</p>

<p>
<b>len</b> is the length of the file name.
</p>

<p>
<b>type</b> is the file type.
</p>

<p>
<b>error</b> contains the error code after method calls (except <b>exit()</b>).
</p>

<p>
<b>init()</b> initializes the instance. The field <b>error</b> will contain the error code.
If the object is successfully initialized, it must be uninitialized by the method <b>exit()</b>.
The iterator is set to the position "before the first".
</p>

<p>
<b>exit()</b> uninitializes the instance. No errors are returned.
</p>

<p>
<b>next()</b> moves to the next file (or directory) in the directory. The return value is <b>true</b>, 
if such file is found. The return value is <b>false</b> in case of error or if there is no more files.
The field <b>error</b> will contain the error code.
Fields <b>file_name</b>, <b>len</b> and <b>type</b> contain file information, if the file is found.
