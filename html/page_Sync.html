<h2>Synchronization objects</h2>

<p>
Multi-threaded applications are impossible without a thread execution coordination. This is achieved
with help of synchronization objects. Synchronization class has a set of methods, some of them may block execution
of the calling thread, until some condition is met.
</p>

<p>
Most of synchronization object in <b>CCore</b> can be named in constructor, using a 
<a href="page_TextLabel.html"><b>TextLabel</b></a>. If the name is not given explicitly, then some 
auto-generated name is used. In <b>HCore</b> the provided name is ignored, but in <b>XCore</b>
it is used by the system log and event recorder. You can get the name of the synchronization object
in <b>XCore</b> by the method <b>getName()</b>.
</p>

<p>
Blocking methods usually have four variants: try-variant which don't block, 
main variant without timeout, and timed variants with <a href="page_MSec.html"><b>MSec</b></a> 
timeout and with <a href="page_TimeScope.html"><b>TimeScope</b></a> timeout.
The variant without timeout always successull (but may block indefinitely). Other variants returns the 
<b>bool</b> return value, which indicates if the method was successful.
</p>

<p>
Releasing methods in <b>XCore</b> usually have three variants: common variant can be called only in a task context,
"_int" variant can be called only in the interrupt context and "_any" variant can be called in any context.
</p>

<p>
Releasing methods often have associated methods, which return a <a href="page_Function.html"><b>Function</b></a>
object, bound with the call of the correspondent releasing method.
</p>

<pre>
   // give
   
   void give();

   // functions
   
   Function&lt;void (void)&gt; function_give() { return FunctionOf(this,&amp;Sem::give); }
</pre>

<p>
If several threads are blocked on a synchronization object, then they are organized in a priority queue.
When one thread should be released, the most prioritized thread is picked up. The thread priority 
counts first, the order of putting into the queue counts last. If the priority of the released task is 
higher, than the priority of the running task, task switch happens immediately.
