<h2>Synchronization objects</h2>

<p>
Multi-threaded applications are impossible without a thread execution coordination. This is implemented
using synchronization objects. Synchronization class has a set of methods, some of them may block execution
of the calling thread, until some condition is met.
</p>

<p>
Most of synchronization object in <b>CCore</b> can be named in constructor, using a 
<a href="page_TextLabel.html"><b>TextLabel</b></a>. If the name is not given explicitly, then some 
auto-generated name is used. In <b>HCore</b> the provided name is ignored, but in <b>XCore</b>
it is used by the system log and event recorder. You can get the name of the synchonization object
in <b>XCore</b> by the method <b>getName()</b>.
</p>

<p>
Blocking methods usually have four variants: try-variant which don't block, 
variant without time-out, with <a href="page_MSec.html"><b>MSec</b></a> 
time-out and with <a href="page_TimeScope.html"><b>TimeScope</b></a> time-out.
The variant without timeout always successull (but may block indefinitely). Other variants returns the 
<b>bool</b> return value, which indicates if the method was successfull.
</p>

<p>
Releasing methods in <b>XCore</b> usually have three variants: common variant can be called only in a task context,
"_int" variant can be called only in the interrupt context and "_any" variant can be called in any context.
Also these methods have associated methods, which returns a <a href="page_Function.html"><b>Function</b></a>
object, bound to the call of the correspondent method.
