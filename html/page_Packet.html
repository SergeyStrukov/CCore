Packets is an infra-structure for efficient flexible parallel mass request processing.
In this infra-structure processing nodes, also called devices, are exchanging packets. Packet is
a task request. It contains a small stack for request parameters and return value and typically has an
attached data buffer to transfer a bulk of data. Packet might be cancelled by the originator.
Each packet device has a packet entry gate, through which packets are coming for processing.
During processing packet can be stored, transferred to another packet device or completed.
Eventually packet must be completed and during completion returned to the packet pool, from which
it was borrowed. Packet cancellation is a mean, the packet originator can use to ask a current
packet device to cancel a packet processing. It is assumed, that packet should be quickly disengaged from the 
processing and completed.
