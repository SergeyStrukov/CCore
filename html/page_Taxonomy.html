<h2>Taxonomy of classes</h2>

<p>
This page provides the list of common terms and the taxonomy of classes. <b>Class</b> in C++ is a very
generic and powerfull entity, so we classify them by its purpose and nature.
</p>

<h3>Terms</h3>

<p>
<b>Efficient</b> means <b>O(1)-nothrow</b>. I.g. it is a sequence of operations, which has a definite,
reasonably small execution time limit and always successful.
</p>


<p>
<b>Derivability</b> is an ability of some entity to be used as the building block of the whole. See, for example,
<a href="page_Swap.html"><b>Swap</b></a>.
</p>


<h3><i>Class</i>ification</h3>

<h4>Word</h4>

<p>
<b>Word</b> is a enumerator, purposed to verbose some generic action. In C++ there is no named constructors.
But it is possible to add an unused argument of a <b>Word</b> type to clearly distinguish between different
overloaded constructors. See, for example, <a href="page_Nothing.html"><b>Nothing</b></a>. 
</p>

<h4>Guard function</h4>

<p>
<b>Guard function</b> ensures some condition. If the required condition is not true, an exception is thrown.
See, for example, <a href="page_PtrLen.html"><b>GuardIndex()</b></a>. Usually, we define a guard function by the following pattern:
</p>

<pre>

void GuardXXXCCC(&lt;arg_list&gt;); // exception throwing function

void GuardXXX(&lt;arg_list&gt;) // guard function 
 {
  if( &lt;not condition&gt; ) GuardXXXCCC(&lt;arg_list&gt;);
 }

</pre>

<p>
Class methods can also be guard methods.
</p>

<h4>Abort function</h4>

<p>
<b>Abort function</b> aborts execution with some diagnostic message. For example, 
<a href="page_Init.html"><b>NoObjectAbort()</b></a> is called when the object has not been initialized.
</p>

<h4>Creator function</h4>

<p>
<b>Creator function</b> creates some object. Normally we create an object using its class constructor. But if we are using
class templates, we have to provide a template argument list. Using <b>Creator function</b> allows infer this list from the
function argument types. See, for example, <a href="page_Tuple.html"><b>MakeTuple()</b></a>:
</p>

<pre>

template &lt;class ... TT&gt;
Tuple&lt;TT...&gt; MakeTuple(const TT &amp; ... tt);

</pre>

<h4>Partial class</h4>

<p>
<b>Partial class</b> is a class not intended for a direct usage, but designed to be a builing block for a derived class.
Like a sophisticated machines, built from a machine parts, in C++ the complex classes can be constructed from a smaller
and simpler classes. Sometimes such parts are not usable alone. Hence we call them <b>Partial</b>. 
See, for example, <a href="page_ToMemBase.html"><b>ToMemBase</b></a>. Such classes often have names ending in "Base".
</p>

<h4>Small Data Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Small Data Type</b> is a type like basic types with a small state and data semantic. These types
have <b>efficient</b> copy constructor and assign operator.
</p>

<pre>

struct Point
 {
  int x;
  int y;
 };

</pre>

<h4>Data Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Data Type</b> is a type with data semantic, but with an arbitary large state. The simplest example is the class 
<a href="page_String.html"><b>String</b></a>.
The purpose of such types is to store some discrete piece of information. The information is stored in some owned buffer.
They may have the copy constructor and the assign operator. These operators can be implemented as <b>efficient</b> 
operations using reference counting.
In <b>CCore</b> we don't make a class copyable if there is no way to make it <b>efficient</b>. In such situation the class
is not copyable, but usually swapable/moveable.
</p>

<h4>Resource Host Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Resource Host Type</b> is a wrapper over some resource handle, like a file descriptor, a socket descriptor, any other OS
object descriptor, object pointer, memory block pointer etc. In destructor the handle is released. The purpose of such types
is to ensure the resource will be eventually released. It also provides some methods to use the resource.
<b>Resource Host Type</b>s are not copyable, but swapable/moveable.
</p>

<h4>Scope Lock Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Scope Lock Type</b> objects are used to "lock" something for the duration of a scope. For example, <b>Mutex::Lock</b>
object is used to lock a mutex:
</p>

<pre>

Mutex mutex;

{
 Mutex::Lock lock(mutex);

 ....
}

</pre>

<p>
<b>Scope Lock Type</b> performs some "entry" operation in its constructor and then when scope is exited by any way 
some "leave" operation in its destructor. 
</p>

<h4>Container Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Container Type</b> is a class, purposed to store another objects. Container not only provides a storage, but also
controls the life-time of contained objects.
</p>

<h4>Resource Provider Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Resource Provider Type</b> is a class, purposed to distribute some resource. For example, the memory. Usually, all
taken resources must be given back before the provider object is destroyed.
</p>

<h4>Pointer Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Pointer Type</b> "points" to another object. It gives access to the object functionality.
</p>

<h4>Cursor</h4>

<p>
<b>Cursor</b> can iterate through a set of objects. In <b>CCore</b> the following interface
is used for cursors:
</p>

<pre>
class Cursor
 {
  public:

   boolable operator + () const; // cursor points to an object

   bool operator ! () const; // cursor is stopped, == !+(*this)

   void operator ++ (); // move to the next object, precondition( +(*this) )

   // read-write variant

   T & operator * () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )

   T * operator -> () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )

   // read-only variant 

   T operator * () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
 };
</pre>

<p>
Here is a typical cursor loop:
</p>

<pre>

R r=....;

for(; +r ;++r) { do_with(*r); }

</pre>

<h4>Range Access Interface</h4>

<p>
<b>Range Access Interface</b> is the interface, used to present a range of objects:
</p>

<pre>
class SomeClass
 {
  public:

   T * getPtr();
   
   const T * getPtr() const;
   
   const T * getPtr_const() const;
   
   ulen getLen() const;
 };
</pre>

<p>
Usually, this interface is implemented by <b>Container Type</b>s or some <b>Proxy Type</b>s.
</p>

<h4>Object Pointer Interface</h4>

<p>
<b>Object Pointer Interface</b> is implemented by <b>Pointer Type</b>s to give access to the pointee object:
</p>

<pre>
class SomeClass
 {
  public:

   boolable operator + () const; // points to an object
   
   bool operator ! () const; // no object, == !+(*this)
  
   T * getPtr() const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
   
   T & operator * () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
   
   T * operator -> () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
 };
</pre>

<p>
This interface can be reduced to
</p>

<pre>
class SomeClass
 {
  public:

   T * getPtr() const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
   
   T & operator * () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
   
   T * operator -> () const; // the current object, precondition( +(*this) )
 };
</pre>

<p>
if the class cannot be in the null state.
</p>

<h4>Property Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Property Type</b> is a kind of classes, providing some properties and meant to be used as the base to
inherit these properties by a derived class. For example, see <a href="page_NoCopy.html"><b>NoCopy</b></a> or
<a href="page_MemoryManagement.html#MemBase"><b>MemBase</b></a>.
</p>

<h4>Helper Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Helper Type</b> is a type, designed to do some job, usually objects of such types are temporary, or local objects.
See, for example, <a href="page_PrintSet.html"><b>PrintSetType</b></a>. <b>Helper Type</b>s are used instead of
functions, in such cases, where, for instance, the object is required, like in the example above.
</p>

<h4>Proxy Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Proxy Type</b> is close to the <b>Helper Type</b>. Objects of such types are used to do some job on behalf
of another type object.
</p>

<h4>Device Type</h4>

<p>
<b>Device Type</b>
</p>

<h4>Algorithm Package</h4>

<p>
<b>Algorithm Package</b> is a stateless class, containing definitions of constants, types, functions. It is purposed
to serve as a template argument to provide an implementation of something. It allows to customize
templated definitions in a very flexible manner. Such class can be huge or small.
See, for example, <a href="page_OwnPtr.html"><b>OwnAlgo</b></a>.
