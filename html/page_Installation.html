<h1>CCore installation</h1>

<h2>Cook book (updated according the latest cygwin and CCore-1.08 development)</h2>

<p>

In order to use <b>CCore</b>, you have to "cook" it.

The following ingredients are required:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse (optional)</a>,</li>
<li><b>CCore</b> package (or repository).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Install <b>Cygwin</b> first. Include <b>make</b>, <b>bash</b> and <b>g++</b> in your installation.<br />
If you are not familiar with this platform, spend some time to learn it. <b>G++</b> version must be at least <b>4.8.2</b>.
</p>
<p>

Create the directory <b>bin</b> in your <b>Cygwin home</b> directory. <b>CCore</b> uses some tools and utilities,
they are built in and invoked from this directory. Make sure this directory is included into the <b>Cygwin path</b>.
You can also include this directory into the <b>Windows path</b>.

</p>
<p>

Unpack <b>CCore</b> package (or checkout the source tree from a repository) somewhere under you <b>Cygwin home</b> directory. <span class="Hint">Avoid file and directory names with space characters.</span>

</p>
<p>

Open <b>bash</b> console (or another console you would prefer, just configure it to use <b>Cygwin bash</b> as a command processor).<br /><br />
Go to the <b>CCore root</b> directory. The following commands are used to prepare, clean and build the whole installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Cmd">make</span> &mdash; to build all,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make warn</span> &mdash; to build all and put errors/warnings into the file <b>warn.txt</b>,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make clean</span> &mdash; to clean,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make list</span> &mdash; to build source file lists; you will need this command if you alter source file set,
<span class="Alert">before using it you have, however, to build <b>CCore</b> tools</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cooking for <b>cygwin64</b> is similar. See <a href="page_Introduction.html#WIN64">these notes</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Post-install notes</h2>

<p>
Once you install and build <b>CCore</b>, tools are built in the <b>~/bin</b> directory.
Two of them: <b>MakeList.exe</b> and <b>Regen.exe</b>, are the essential part of the build process, <span class="Alert">so keep them in the working condition</span>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cygwin</b> terminal has a limitation in its console functions. It cannot be used to run some tools 
and tests. You can use the following <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console">console program</a> instead to avoid troubles.
</p>

<p>
You can use <b>Eclipse</b> as an <b>IDE</b> to work with <b>CCore</b> and <b>CCore</b>-based projects. <b>CCore</b> package includes
the archive <b>eclipse-Kepler.7z</b> with the <b>Eclipse Kepler</b> workbench. 
You will need <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html">Anonymouse Pro</a> 
font for the text editor. Before using this workbench you have to adjust some settings.
</p>

<p>
Open menu <b>Window/Preferences...</b> . Then open the <b>C++/Build/Environment</b> tab. 
Correct the variable <b>CCORE_ROOT</b> to point to the <b>CCore root</b> directory.
Correct also variables <b>CYGWIN</b> and <b>CYGWIN64</b> to point to <b>cygwin</b> or <b>cygwin64</b> 
installation directories.
</p>

<p>
Then open the <b>General/Workspace/Linked Resources</b> tab and correct the path variable <b>Root</b> again
to the <b>CCore root</b> directory.
</p>

<p>
There is a runnable project in the workbench: <b>WIN32-test</b>. You have to adjust paths in the project launch configuration also.
Right-click on the project, pick the Properties dialog and and select <b>Run/Debug Settings</b> tab. Open the launch configuration for edit.
Correct paths in the <b>Main</b> and <b>Arguments</b> tabs.
</p>

<p>
You likely would have to refresh linked resources, select each project and press <b>F5</b>.
Finally, customize <b>Eclipse</b> as you like.
