<h1>CCore installation</h1>

<h2>Cook book</h2>

<p>

In order to use <b>CCore</b>, you have to "cook" it.

The following ingredients are required:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>,</li>
<li>compiler set,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse (optional)</a>,</li>
<li>CCore package (or repository).</li>
</ul>

<p>

Install <b>cygwin</b> first. Include <b>make</b> and <b>bash</b> in your installation.<br />
If you are not familiar with this platform spent some time to learn it.

</p>
<p>

Unpack the compiler set (provided as the archive <b>opt.7z</b>) in the <b>cygwin root</b>.<br />
You will need <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> archive manager.
You will get the <b>opt</b> directory with several <b>gcc</b> compilers.<br />
You can also build compilers from the sources yourself. See <a href="#build-gcc">below</a> for instructions.

</p>
<p>

Copy 4 dlls from the directory <b>/opt/gcc-4.7.0/bin</b> (or from another newer host compiler directory) to
the <b>/bin</b> directory (all pathes here are <b>cygwin</b> pathes, dlls are <b>cyggcc_s-1.dll,
cygssp-0.dll, cygstdc++-6.dll, cygquadmath-0.dll</b>).<br />
It is neccessary to make host programs runable.

</p>
<p>

Create the directory <b>bin</b> in your <b>cygwin home</b> directory. <b>CCore</b> uses some tools and utilities,
they are built in and invoked from this directory. Make sure this directory is included in the <b>cygwin path</b>.

</p>
<p>

Unpack CCore package (or checkout the source tree from a repository) somewere under you <b>cygwin home</b> directory. <span class="Hint">Avoid file and directory names with space characters.</span>

</p>
<p>

Open <b>bash</b> console (or another console you would prefer, just configure it to use <b>cygwin bash</b> as a command processor).<br /><br />
Go to the <b>CCore root</b> directory. The following commands are used to prepare, clean and build the whole installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Cmd">make</span> &mdash; to build all,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make warn</span> &mdash; to build all and put errors/warnings into <b>warn.txt</b> file,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make clean</span> &mdash; to clean,</li>
<li><span class="Cmd">make list</span> &mdash; to build source file lists; you will need this command if you alter source file set,
<span class="Alert">before using it you have, however, build CCore tools</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post-install notes</h2>

<p>
Once you install and build <b>CCore</b>, tools are built in the <b>~/bin</b> directory.
Two of them: <b>MakeList.exe</b> and <b>Regen.exe</b>, are the essential part of the build process, <span class="Alert">so keep them in the working condition</span>.
</p>

<p>
You can use <b>Eclipse</b> as an IDE to work with <b>CCore</b> and CCore-based projects. <b>CCore</b> package includes
the archive <b>eclipse.7z</b> with the <b>Eclipse Indigo</b> workbench. You will need <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html">Anonymouse Pro</a> 
font for text editor. Before using this workbench you have to adjust some settings.<br />
Open menu <b>Window/Preferences...</b> . Then open the <b>C++/Build/Environment</b> tab. 
Correct the variable <b>CCORE_ROOT</b> to point to the <b>CCore root</b> directory.<br /> 
Then open the <b>General/Workspace/Linked Resources</b> tab and correct the path variable <b>Root</b> again
to the <b>CCore root</b> directory.<br />
There is a runable project in the workbench: <b>WIN32-test</b>. You have to adjust pathes in the project launch configuration also.
Right-click on the project, pick the Properties dialog and and select <b>Run/Debug Settings</b> tab. Open the launch configuration for edit.
Correct pathes in the <b>Main</b> and <b>Arguments</b> tabs.<br />
You likely would have to refresh linked resources, select each project and press F5.
Finally, customize <b>Eclipse</b> as you like.
