<h2>XCore task events</h2>

<p>
XCore generates number of events during task execution from synchronization operations and task switches.
</p>

<h2>Task switch events</h2>

<p>
Task switch events are generated when task switch occurs or interupt occurs. Task is assigned
an enum value of the <b>TaskNumber</b> type. The name, given to the task, is also
assigned to the correspondent task number. Two special value: <b>EnterInt</b> and <b>LeaveInt</b>, are used
to designate entry of the interrupt context and exit of the interrupt context.
Task switch generates an event of the <b>TaskSwitchEvent</b> type. 
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">TaskSwitchEvent</span> // meta-named as TaskSwitch
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 task;
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>task</b> is the number of the task, which become active. The correspondent marker is
<b>Up</b> for <b>EnterInt</b>, <b>Down</b> for <b>LeaveInt</b> and <b>Push</b> for tasks.
</p>

<h2>Mutex events</h2>

<p>
Mutex is assigned an enum value of the <b>MutexNumber</b> type. The name, given to the mutex, is also
assigned to the correspondent mutex number. Mutex generates events of the <b>MutexEvent</b> type. 
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">MutexEvent</span> // meta-named as MutexEvent
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 task;
  uint16 mutex;
  uint8 type;
  
  enum Type : uint8
   {
    Lock,
    Unlock,
    IncLock,
    DecLock,
    Block
   };
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>task</b> is a task number.
</p>

<p>
<b>mutex</b> is a mutex number.
</p>

<p>
<b>type</b> is an event type. There are five event types.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lock</b> is generated when the task locks the mutex. 
The correspondent maker is <b>Up</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unlock</b> is generated when the task unlocks the mutex. 
The correspondent maker is <b>Down</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>IncLock</b> is generated when the task increments the lock count of the mutex, 
which is already locked by the task. 
The correspondent maker is <b>Inc</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>DecLock</b> is generated when the task decrements the lock count of the mutex,
which is remaning locked by the task. 
The correspondent maker is <b>Dec</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Block</b> is generated when the task becomes blocked by the mutex, which is already locked
by another task.
The correspondent maker is <b>UpBlock</b>.
</p>

<h2>Sem events</h2>

<p>
Semaphore is assigned an enum value of the <b>SemNumber</b> type. The name, given to the semaphore, is also
assigned to the correspondent semaphore number. Semaphore generates events of the <b>SemEvent</b> type
and the <b>SemEvent_task</b> type. 
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">SemEvent</span> // meta-named as SemEvent
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 sem;
  uint8 type;
  
  enum Type : uint8
   {
    ToTaskList,
    Give,
    GiveMany
   };
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>sem</b> is a sem number.
</p>

<p>
<b>type</b> is an event type. There are three event types.
</p>

<p>
<b>ToTaskList</b> is generated when a group of tasks being released by the <b>give_many()</b> operation.
The correspondent marker is <b>UpUpPush</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Give</b> is generated when the semaphore being given.
The correspondent marker is <b>Up</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>GiveMany</b> is generated when the semaphore being given many times.
The correspondent marker is <b>UpUp</b>.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">SemEvent_task</span> // meta-named as SemEventTask
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 task;
  uint16 sem;
  uint8 type;
  
  enum Type : uint8
   {
    ToTask, 
    Take,    
    Block  
   };
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>task</b> is a task number.
</p>

<p>
<b>sem</b> is a semaphore number.
</p>

<p>
<b>type</b> is an event type. There are three event types.
</p>

<p>
<b>ToTask</b> is generated when the task being released by the semaphore, which being given by another task
or interrupt. 
The correspondent marker is <b>UpPush</b>.
</p>

<p>                                    
<b>Take</b> is generated when the task takes the semaphore. 
The correspondent marker is <b>Down</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Block</b> is generated when the task becomes blocked by the empty semaphore. 
The correspondent marker is <b>DownBlock</b>.
</p>

<h2>Event events</h2>

<p>
Event is assigned an enum value of the <b>EventNumber</b> type. The name, given to the event, is also
assigned to the correspondent event number. Event generates events of the <b>EventEvent</b> type
and the <b>EventEvent_task</b> type. 
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">EventEvent</span>
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 event;
  uint8 type;
  
  enum Type : uint8
   {
    Trigger
   };
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>event</b> is an event number.
</p>

<p>
<b>type</b> is an event type. There is only one event type.
</p>

<p>
<b>Trigger</b> is generated when the event being triggered.
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">EventEvent_task</span>
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 task;
  uint16 event;
  uint8 type;
  
  enum Type : uint8
   {
    ToTask,
    Consume,
    Block
   };
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>task</b> is a task number.
</p>

<p>
<b>event</b> is an event number.
</p>

<p>
<b>type</b> is an event type. There are three event types.
</p>

<p>
<b>ToTask</b> is generated when the task being released by the event, which being triggered by another task
or interrupt.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consume</b> is generated when the task consumes the event.
</p>

<p>
<b>Block</b> is generated when the task becomes blocked by the empty event.
