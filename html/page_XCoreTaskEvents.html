<h2>XCore task events</h2>

<p>
XCore generates number of events during task execution from synchronization operations and task switches.
</p>

<h2>Task switch events</h2>

<p>
Task switch events are generated when task switch occurs or interrupt occurs. Task is assigned
an enum value of the <b>TaskNumber</b> type. The name, given to the task, is also
assigned to the correspondent task number. Two special value: <b>EnterInt</b> and <b>LeaveInt</b>, are used
to designate entry of the interrupt context and exit of the interrupt context.
Task switch generates an event of the <b>TaskSwitchEvent</b> type. 
</p>

<pre>

struct <span class="Att">TaskSwitchEvent</span> // meta-named as TaskSwitch
 {
  EventTimeType time;
  EventIdType id;
  
  uint16 task;
 };

</pre>

<p>
<b>task</b> is the number of the task, which become active. The correspondent marker is
<b>Up</b> for <b>EnterInt</b>, <b>Down</b> for <b>LeaveInt</b> and <b>Push</b> for tasks.
</p>

<h2>Mutex events</h2>

<p>
Mutex is assigned an enum value of the <b>MutexNumber</b> type. The name, given to the mutex, is also
assigned to the correspondent mutex number. Mutex generates events of the <b>MutexEvent</b> type. 
</p>

<pre>

The correspondent maker is <b>Up</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unlock</b> is generated when the task unlocks the mutex.

</p>

<p>

which is already locked by the task. 
The correspondent maker is <b>Inc</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>DecLock</b> is generated when the task decrements the lock count of the mutex,
which is remaining locked by the task. 
The correspondent maker is <b>Dec</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Block</b> is generated when the task becomes blocked by the mutex, which is already locked
by another task.
The correspondent maker is <b>UpBlock</b>.
</p>
